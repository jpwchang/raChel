The raChel programming language

This is a set of macros for C++ allowing users to program with Rachelism-like source code.
An example program written in raChel (example.cpp) is included.
To write your own programs in raChel, simply include the following line at the top of your code:
#include "Rachel.h"
(Your source file will have to be in the same directory as Rachel.h)
Note that this language depends on the auto keyword, introduced with C++ 11
Therefore, you will need a C++ 11 compatible compiler to use raChel.
C++ 11 is supported by Visual Studio 2013 and up and gcc 4.7 and up.
